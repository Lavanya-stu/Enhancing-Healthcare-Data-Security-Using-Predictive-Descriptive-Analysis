# Enhancing-Healthcare-Data-Security-Using-Predictive-Descriptive-Analysis
Enhanced healthcare data security using machine learning models like Random Forest, achieving 91% accuracy in predicting data breaches. This project offers proactive protection for electronic health records (EHR) and personal health information (PHI), providing valuable insights for cybersecurity in healthcare

## Project Overview
This project addresses the critical need for data security in the healthcare sector by utilizing machine learning models to predict and prevent potential data breaches. With a focus on Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Personal Health Information (PHI), this research leverages predictive and descriptive analytics to identify patterns and forecast cybersecurity threats.

## Objectives
- **Enhance Data Security**: Protect sensitive healthcare data by identifying trends and predicting breaches.
- **Proactive Measures**: Shift from reactive to proactive security strategies using predictive analytics.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the effectiveness of various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.

## Data
The dataset, sourced from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, includes historical records of healthcare data breaches, entity types, and affected individuals. Key preprocessing steps include data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.

## Methods
1. **Descriptive Analysis**: Identified patterns and trends in historical data breaches.
2. **Predictive Models**: Trained and evaluated four machine learning models to forecast data breaches.
3. **Model Comparison**: Random Forest emerged as the most effective model, achieving over 91% accuracy.

## Results
- **Random Forest** was the most accurate and robust, with 91% accuracy.
- **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Trees** also performed well, while **Neural Networks** showed lower accuracy, likely due to dataset size.

## Usage
- Clone the repository and access the code and documentation.
- Follow instructions in the user manual for setting up the environment and running the code.

## Future Work
- Explore real-time predictive analytics and adaptive models.
- Investigate the application of these models in other data-sensitive sectors.
